### Leo: Open-Source Readiness Follow-Through — 2026-10-03

**Scope:** Finished a local open-source readiness pass without publishing changes.

**Summary:** Included colocated app tests in Vitest, corrected an outdated profile assertion, handled malformed development map-pin requests, added format and Cloudflare/OpenNext checks to CI, updated contributor and API guidance, removed a screenshot with an outdated personal name, refreshed dependencies to clear production audit findings, and documented the unresolved header-scanner runtime issue.

**Verification:** Secrets, formatting, typecheck, lint, 920 tests, Next.js build, Cloudflare/OpenNext build, output verification, Wrangler dry run, production dependency audit, and `git diff --check` passed.

**Follow-ups:** Review 14 development-tool dependency advisories and non-English translation gaps. Decide on the header-scanner egress design and proxy-specific client-IP header trust before changing security behavior.

---

### Leo: Public Positioning and Cloudflare Readiness — 2026-10-03

**Scope:** Corrected the production Worker configuration and public project guidance without deploying.

**Summary:** Removed a stray info-site Worker name from the main Wrangler file after verifying the two Workers separately. Replaced the public vulnerability issue route with private email reporting, because GitHub private vulnerability reporting is disabled. Updated public links, metadata, About copy, footer, product relationships, contributor guidance, and current Cloudflare/OpenNext architecture and release documentation.

**Verification:** Typecheck, lint, secrets scan, 912 tests, Next.js build, Cloudflare/OpenNext build, output verification, and Wrangler dry run passed. Translation parity reports existing campus/Sylla gaps in non-English locales. No commit, push, deployment, or PR.

**Follow-ups:** Review translation quality and separately evaluate the header-scanner DNS rebinding fix before implementation.

### Leo: App-Icon Logo Rebrand — 2026-07-07

**Scope:** Replaced the Macquarie University crest logo with the new Syllabus Sync app-icon image across the entire app.

**Summary:** Cropped the supplied app-icon artwork (rounded-square, red/white building + book motif) into an edge-to-edge square master and regenerated the full PWA/favicon icon set (`favicon.ico`, `apple-touch-icon.png`, `icon-192/384/512.png`, `maskable-512.png`) from it. Repointed all ~25 code references — login, signup, header, sidebar, onboarding, reset-password, OG/Twitter meta images, the JSON-LD organization schema, and the push-notification icon fallback in both `lib/server/push.ts` and `lib/services/notificationService.ts` — from `/MQ_Logo_Final.png` to the new `/syllabus-sync-logo.png`, then deleted the old crest file. Updated `public/sw.js`'s precache list and push-notification fallback to the new path and bumped its cache versions (`syllabus-sync-v6` → `v7`, `-static-v6` → `-static-v7`, `-dynamic-v6` → `-dynamic-v7`) so installed service workers fetch the new assets instead of serving the stale crest from cache. Rewrote the `mqLogoAlt` translation value in all 35 locale files from a hardcoded "Macquarie University logo" translation to a `{{appName}}`-interpolated string (matching the existing `welcomeTo` pattern), and updated all 10 call sites to pass `{ appName: APP_CONFIG.name }`, so alt text now reads "Syllabus Sync Logo" (localized) instead of the old university-crest wording.

**Files Changed:** `public/syllabus-sync-logo.png` (new), `public/icons/icon-192.png`, `public/icons/icon-384.png`, `public/icons/icon-512.png`, `public/icons/maskable-512.png`, `public/apple-touch-icon.png`, `public/icons/apple-touch-icon.png`, `app/favicon.ico`, `public/MQ_Logo_Final.png` (deleted), `app/layout.tsx`, `app/home/page.tsx`, `app/calendar/page.tsx`, `app/map/page.tsx`, `app/feed/page.tsx`, `app/manage-profiles/layout.tsx`, `app/login/LoginClient.tsx`, `app/signup/SignupClient.tsx`, `app/onboarding/OnboardingClient.tsx`, `app/reset-password/reset-password-client.tsx`, `components/layout/Header.tsx`, `components/layout/Sidebar.tsx`, `lib/server/push.ts`, `lib/services/notificationService.ts`, `public/sw.js`, `locales/*/translations.json` (35 files).

**Verification:** `npm run check` passed (secrets, format, typecheck, lint, test, build) ✅; `npm run check:i18n` passed ✅; manually confirmed the new icon renders on `/login` and as the browser favicon ✅.

**Follow-ups:** None.

### Leo: CI/CD Test Suite Remediation — 2026-04-07

**Scope:** Resolved authentication pipeline test failures causing CI blockages.

1.  **Fixed Auth Redirect Logic:** Updated `app/auth/callback/route.ts` to correctly prioritize and honor the `redirectTo` parameter (e.g., `/map`) after successful email verification, rather than hard-defaulting to the login page.
2.  **Anti-Enumeration Compliance:** Modified `app/api/auth/signup/route.ts` to consistently return a `200 OK` generic success response for existing accounts. This aligns with security best practices to prevent account enumeration and satisfies the requirements of the Vitest suite.
3.  **Full Suite Validation:** Verified the fix by running all 878 project tests, ensuring 100% pass rate and no regressions in the security posture.

**Files Changed:**

- `app/auth/callback/route.ts`
- `app/api/auth/signup/route.ts`

**Verification:**

- `npm run test` (878/878 passed) ✅
- Manual verification of signup flow logic ✅

### Leo: About, Contact, Terms & Privacy Pages Bug Hunt & Production Hardening — 2026-04-06

**Scope:** Bug fixes, SEO, accessibility, design token compliance, and performance across 4 public pages.

**Summary:** Deep-reviewed all 4 public pages. Found and fixed 22 issues across 8 files (4 RSC wrappers + 4 client components). All 4 pages were `'use client'` at the page file level — metadata could not be exported, breaking SEO for all public-facing pages. Resolved by splitting each page into an RSC `page.tsx` (exports `metadata` + `Suspense` wrapper with ARIA-compliant loading skeleton) and a `*-client.tsx` (client component, following the established pattern from login/signup/reset-password). All 4 hero banners had hardcoded hex colors: `from-[#8B1525] via-[#A6192E] to-[#76232f]` → `from-mq-red-deep via-mq-primary to-mq-red-deep`; `text-[#FFB81C]` → `text-mq-warning`; `bg-[#FFB81C]/10` → `bg-mq-warning/10`; `bg-[#FFB81C]` → `bg-mq-warning`; `from-[#76232f]/50` → `from-mq-red-deep/50`. About page: CTA `<Link>` missing `group` class — `group-hover:translate-x-0.5` on `ArrowRight` never fired → added `group`; sections missing `aria-labelledby` and h2s missing matching `id` attributes → added; missing `<main>` landmark → added. Contact page: `text-mq-danger` used for error text — this token is NOT defined in the Tailwind config (only `mq-error` exists), making error messages invisible → corrected to `text-mq-error`; helpful-links `<article>` missing `group` class — `group-hover:opacity-100` on `ArrowRight` never fired → migrated to scoped `group/link` + `group-hover/link:opacity-100` pattern; email input and feedback textarea had no `maxLength` → added `maxLength={254}` and `maxLength={2000}`; error `<p>` missing `id` + `role="alert"` and textarea missing `aria-describedby` → error never announced to screen readers, fixed with matching `id="feedback-error"` and `aria-describedby`; added `noValidate` to form (browser native validation bypassed in favour of custom); missing `<main>` landmark → added. Terms page: `ArrowLeft` icon missing `aria-hidden="true"` → added; all `<section>` elements missing `scroll-mt-8` — TOC anchor links scrolled the heading behind the sticky nav → added; sections now have `aria-labelledby` + h2 `id` pairs; missing `<main>` → added. Privacy page: `ArrowLeft` icon missing `aria-hidden="true"` → added; `TABLE_ROWS` extracted to module-level constant, table rows now keyed by `row[0]` (stable translation key) instead of array index; privacy complaint `mailto:` subject not `encodeURIComponent`-encoded — spaces in subject broke some email clients → computed `privacyComplaintHref` with encoded subject in component body; `scroll-mt-8` added to all 14 sections; `aria-labelledby` + h2 `id` on all 14 sections; missing `<main>` → added.

**Files Changed:** `app/about/page.tsx`, `app/about/about-client.tsx` (new), `app/contact/page.tsx`, `app/contact/contact-client.tsx` (new), `app/terms/page.tsx`, `app/terms/terms-client.tsx` (new), `app/privacy/page.tsx`, `app/privacy/privacy-client.tsx` (new).

**Verification:** Typecheck clean ✅; Lint clean ✅; 874/878 tests pass (4 pre-existing signup failures, unrelated) ✅.

**Follow-ups:** None.

### Leo: Reset Password Page Bug Hunt & Production Hardening — 2026-04-06

**Scope:** Bug fixes, performance, accessibility, i18n/token compliance, and code quality across 2 reset-password page files.

**Summary:** Deep-reviewed all 2 reset-password files. Found and fixed 15 issues: `page.tsx` `ResetPasswordSkeleton` missing `role="status"`, `aria-busy="true"`, `aria-label` ARIA semantics → added. `reset-password-client.tsx`: module-level `requestSchema` recreated on every import → moved into component as `useMemo`; unsafe `tStr = t as (key: string) => string` cast used across 7 callsites → removed cast, replaced all `tStr(...)` with direct `t(...)` (typed); `setSchema` dep array referenced `tStr` instead of `t` → fixed; both `z.string().min()` validation calls in `setSchema` missing translation key → added `t('validation.passwordTooShort')`; `console.error` × 2 on auth/code exchange errors → `logger.error`; `setMode` called directly in auth listener creating stale closure risk on every mode change → replaced with `modeRef` pattern: `modeRef` synced via `useEffect(() => { modeRef.current = mode; }, [mode])` and listener reads `modeRef.current` without re-subscribing; `onRequest` not memoized → `useCallback([t])`; `onSet` not memoized → `useCallback([isAuthenticated, supabase.auth, t])`; auth listener had `mode` in dependency array (caused unnecessary re-subscribe on each mode transition) → removed from deps; all 3 `from-[#001528]/88` hardcoded hex in gradient overlays → `from-mq-navy-900/88`; loading container missing `role="status"` + `aria-live="polite"` → added; `Loader2` missing `aria-hidden="true"` → added; success state `bg-green-500/15 border-green-500/20 text-green-500` → `bg-mq-success/15 border-mq-success/20 text-mq-success`; icon `aria-hidden` missing on `CheckCircle2`/`XCircle` in alerts; `aria-invalid`/`aria-describedby` missing on all 3 form inputs (email, newPassword, confirmPassword) → added with matching `id` on error paragraphs; `Mail`/`Eye`/`EyeOff` decorative icons missing `aria-hidden="true"` → added; both `text-red-500` error paragraph classes → `text-mq-error`.

**Files Changed:** `app/reset-password/page.tsx`, `app/reset-password/reset-password-client.tsx`.

**Verification:** Typecheck clean ✅; Lint clean ✅; 874/878 tests pass (4 pre-existing signup failures, unrelated) ✅.

**Follow-ups:** None.

### Leo: Sign Up Page Bug Hunt & Production Hardening — 2026-04-06

**Scope:** Bug fixes, performance, accessibility, i18n/token compliance, and code quality across 4 signup page files.

**Summary:** Deep-reviewed all 4 signup page files. Found and fixed 19 issues: `page.tsx` `SignupSkeleton` missing `role="status"`, `aria-busy="true"`, `aria-label` ARIA semantics → added. `SignupClient.tsx`: replaced `import clsx from 'clsx'` with `import { cn } from '@/lib/utils'` (project standard — tailwind-merge wrapper) and updated all 6 `clsx()` callsites to `cn()`; `signupSchema` recreated every render → `useMemo`; `handleGoogleLogin` not memoized → `useCallback`; `handleNextStep` not memoized → `useCallback`; `useEffect` faculty/course cascade resets fired on mount (setting empty to empty is harmless but antipattern) → added `prevFacultyRef`/`prevCourseRef` guards; `fullNameRef` callback called `register('fullName')` inside the ref on every render → destructured `registerFullNameRef` + `registerFullNameProps` at top level; all `text-red-500` on error messages (9 occurrences) → `text-mq-error`; all required `*` asterisks (6 occurrences) `text-red-500` → `text-mq-error`; password strength label `text-red-500`/`text-green-600` → `text-mq-error`/`text-mq-success`; year `SelectTrigger` `border-red-500` → `border-mq-error` + added `aria-invalid`/`aria-describedby`; submit button redundant `opacity-50 cursor-not-allowed` class (already handled by `disabled`) → removed; `aria-invalid`/`aria-describedby` added to all 8 form inputs with matching `id` on error paragraphs; honeypot `style={{ display: 'none' }}` inline style → `className="hidden"`; background gradient `from-[#001528]/88` hardcoded hex → `from-mq-navy-900/88`; passed `error={!!errors.faculty}` to `FacultySelect` (previously had no way to show red trigger border on validation). `CourseCombobox.tsx`: `border-red-500` → `border-mq-error`; `updateDropdownPosition` not memoized (called in effect and toggle handler) → `useCallback` + added to useEffect dep array; search input missing `aria-label` → added; Escape key on search input didn't close dropdown and return focus → added `onKeyDown` handler. `FacultySelect.tsx`: added `error?: boolean` prop and conditional `border-mq-error`/`border-mq-border` + `aria-invalid` on the trigger.

**Files Changed:** `app/signup/page.tsx`, `app/signup/SignupClient.tsx`, `app/signup/components/CourseCombobox.tsx`, `app/signup/components/FacultySelect.tsx`.

**Verification:** Typecheck clean ✅; Lint clean ✅; 874/878 tests pass (4 pre-existing signup failures, unrelated) ✅.

**Follow-ups:** None.

### Leo: Login Page Bug Hunt & Production Hardening — 2026-04-06

**Scope:** Bug fixes, performance, accessibility, i18n completeness, and design token compliance across 4 login page files.

**Summary:** Deep-reviewed all 6 login page files. Found and fixed 15 issues: `LoginClient.tsx` had `localLoginSchema` recreated on every render → `useMemo`; `text-red-500` on email/password error messages → `text-mq-error`; `aria-invalid`/`aria-describedby` missing on both form inputs; hardcoded English provider-mismatch error strings in two separate locations — `onSubmit` handler and `callbackError` banner → both now use `t('loginErrorProviderMismatchGoogle')` / `t('loginErrorProviderMismatchEmail')` (keys added to `locales/en/translations.json`); hardcoded hex `text-[#18181b]`/`text-[#3f3f46]` in right panel hero copy → `text-mq-content`/`text-mq-content-secondary`; template literal `className` on passkey badge, MFA badge, and passkey button → `cn()`; `handlePasskeyLogin` not memoized → `useCallback`; `handleGoogleLogin` not memoized → `useCallback`; misleading `aria-disabled` on `<Link>` tag (attribute is non-functional on anchors and doesn't prevent navigation) → removed. `page.tsx` `LoginSkeleton` missing `role="status"`, `aria-busy="true"`, `aria-label` ARIA semantics → added. `MFAChallenge.tsx` error container used `text-red-500` → `text-mq-error`; all 4 buttons missing `type="button"` → added; code input missing `aria-label`, `aria-describedby`, `aria-invalid` → added; error container missing `role="alert"` → added; resend cooldown `setInterval` had no cleanup on unmount — if component unmounted mid-countdown the interval continued running → added `cooldownIntervalRef` (persisted in `useRef`) plus a cleanup `useEffect`. `usePasskeyLogin.ts` had `console.error(err)` on catch → `logger.error`.

**Files Changed:** `app/login/LoginClient.tsx`, `app/login/page.tsx`, `app/login/components/MFAChallenge.tsx`, `app/login/hooks/usePasskeyLogin.ts`, `locales/en/translations.json`.

**Verification:** Typecheck clean ✅; Lint clean ✅; 874/878 tests pass (4 pre-existing signup failures, unrelated) ✅.

**Follow-ups:** None.

### Leo: Manage Profiles Page Bug Hunt & Production Hardening — 2026-04-06

**Scope:** Bug fixes, performance, accessibility, design token compliance, and security hardening across 9 manage-profiles files.

**Summary:** Deep-reviewed all 12 manage-profiles files. Found and fixed 18 issues: `PersonalInfoCard` had `border-red-500`/`text-red-500` error styling → `border-mq-error`/`text-mq-error`; email input missing `id="email"` breaking Label association; `aria-describedby` missing on all three fields with error states → added with matching `id` on error paragraphs; hardcoded student ID placeholder `"12345678"` → `t('studentIdPlaceholder')`. `AcademicInfoCard` had hardcoded hex colors `bg-[#FFB81C]/15` + `text-[#c08c00]` on section icon → `bg-mq-warning/15` + `text-mq-warning`; `text-red-500`/`border-red-500` error styling on all three fields → `mq-error` tokens; `aria-describedby` and `aria-invalid` missing from year SelectTrigger. `error.tsx` had `bg-red-100 dark:bg-red-900/20 text-red-600 dark:text-red-400` → `bg-mq-error/10 text-mq-error`. `ProfileSkeleton` missing `role="status"`, `aria-busy="true"`, `aria-label` ARIA semantics. `page.tsx` reload button missing `type="button"`; `RefreshCw` className used string template literal instead of `cn()` utility — fixed both. `ProfileHeader` missing file MIME type validation (only size was checked — non-image files could be uploaded) → added `file.type.startsWith('image/')` guard; `handleAvatarChange` not memoized → `useCallback`. `useProfileManager` had `profileSchema` recreated on every render → `useMemo`; dead code in `onSubmit` error branch where first `if` set `errorMessage` to the same default value → collapsed to single `else if`; `reloadProfile` always fired success toast even when `fetchProfile()` threw → wrapped in try/catch. `actions.ts` had unprofessional rate-limit error message → neutral language; misleading catch label "Validation failed" on a `revalidatePath` error → corrected to "Cache revalidation failed"; hardcoded success message tidied. `profilesStore.ts` had redundant `console.error` immediately before `errorHandler.logError` → removed; hardcoded verbose avatar error toast → shortened.

**Files Changed:** `app/manage-profiles/components/PersonalInfoCard.tsx`, `app/manage-profiles/components/AcademicInfoCard.tsx`, `app/manage-profiles/error.tsx`, `app/manage-profiles/components/ProfileSkeleton.tsx`, `app/manage-profiles/page.tsx`, `app/manage-profiles/components/ProfileHeader.tsx`, `app/manage-profiles/hooks/useProfileManager.ts`, `app/manage-profiles/actions.ts`, `lib/store/profilesStore.ts`.

**Verification:** Typecheck clean ✅; Lint clean ✅; 874/878 tests pass (4 pre-existing signup failures, unrelated) ✅.

**Follow-ups:** None.

### Leo: Event Settings Page Bug Hunt & Production Hardening — 2026-04-06

**Scope:** Bug fixes, performance, accessibility, and MQ token compliance across 4 event-settings files

1. **`EventForm.tsx` — silent failure on save:** `handleSave` had no `catch` block — if `addEvent`/`updateEvent` threw, the dialog stayed open with the spinner stuck and the user received zero feedback. Added `catch` with `toastUtils.error`.
2. **`EventForm.tsx` — redundant double-reset:** `handleOpenChange` called `resetForm()` when `newOpen === true`, but the `useEffect` already dispatches RESET whenever `open` changes. Removed the redundant `resetForm()` call (and the now-unused `resetForm` function).
3. **`EventForm.tsx` — `handleSave`, `handleDelete`, `validateForm` not memoized:** All three were recreated on every render; `handleSave` and `handleDelete` are passed as `onClick` props. Wrapped all three in `useCallback` with correct dependency arrays. `handleOpenChange` also memoized.
4. **`EventForm.tsx` — color picker missing `aria-pressed`:** Screen readers had no way to identify which color is currently selected. Added `aria-pressed={color === colorOption.value}` to each color button.
5. **`EventForm.tsx` — misleading dead comment on `endAt`:** `endAt: undefined // Could be parsed from "2:00 PM - 4:00 PM" format` was misleading — the input is `type="time"` (HH:MM only). Removed the misleading comment.
6. **`EventDetailPanel.tsx` — non-MQ status colors:** `text-emerald-600` (today) and `text-amber-600` (tomorrow) replaced with `text-mq-success` and `text-mq-warning`.
7. **`EventDetailPanel.tsx` — non-MQ navigation button hover classes:** `hover:text-emerald-600 hover:bg-emerald-500/10 dark:hover:bg-emerald-500/20` replaced with `hover:text-mq-success hover:bg-mq-success/10`.
8. **`EventDetailPanel.tsx` — hardcoded hex colors in `useMemo`:** The category dot colors used hex strings (`#3B82F6`, `#8B5CF6`, etc.) in `style={{ backgroundColor }}`. Replaced with CSS custom properties (`var(--mq-info)`, `var(--mq-purple)`, `var(--mq-success)`, `var(--mq-warning)`, `var(--mq-primary)`) to respect theming.
9. **`EventDetailPanel.tsx` — `handleNavigationClick` not memoized:** Passed to a `button`'s `onClick` but recreated every render. Wrapped in `useCallback`.
10. **`app/settings/layout.tsx` — nav buttons missing `type="button"`:** Both mobile and desktop nav buttons lacked `type="button"`, risking accidental form submission. Added to all buttons.
11. **`app/settings/layout.tsx` — nav buttons missing `aria-current="page"`:** Screen readers couldn't identify the active settings section. Added `aria-current={isActive ? 'page' : undefined}` to all nav buttons.
12. **`app/settings/layout.tsx` — raw Tailwind colors for section icons:** `text-blue-500`, `text-purple-500`, `text-green-500`, `text-amber-500`, `text-slate-500` replaced with MQ tokens: `text-mq-info`, `text-mq-purple`, `text-mq-success`, `text-mq-warning`, `text-mq-content-secondary`.
13. **`app/settings/layout.tsx` — `navigateToSection` not memoized:** Recreated on every render and passed as `onClick` to multiple buttons. Wrapped in `useCallback([router])`.
14. **`NotificationSettings.tsx` — double `if (!result)` pattern:** Two separate `if` checks on the same `result` value was confusing and implied independent logic. Refactored to a clean `if...else`.
15. **`NotificationSettings.tsx` — hardcoded `'minutes'` in timing fallback:** `${minutes} minutes` bypassed i18n. Replaced with `t('timingMinutes', { minutes })`.

**Files Changed:**

- `components/events/EventForm.tsx`
- `components/events/EventDetailPanel.tsx`
- `app/settings/layout.tsx`
- `features/settings/components/NotificationSettings.tsx`

**Verification:**

- TypeScript: `npm run typecheck` — clean ✅
- Lint: `npm run lint` — Lint OK ✅
- Tests: 874/878 passed ✅ (4 pre-existing signup failures, unrelated)

### Leo: Event Feed Page Bug Hunt & Production Hardening — 2026-04-06

**Scope:** Bug fixes, performance, accessibility, type safety, i18n, and MQ token compliance across 12 feed files

1. **`usePublicFeed.ts` — time filters showed past events:** `today`, `week`, and `month` branches had no lower bound, so past events leaked through. Fixed by adding `>= startOfDay` (today) and `>= now` (week/month) guards, plus a proper `endOfDay` window for today.
2. **`useFeedLogic.ts` — dead code block:** The second `if (remindedEvents.has(eventId))` check at line 138 was unreachable — the identical guard at line 115 already returned early. Removed the dead block.
3. **`useFeedLogic.ts` — wrong `timeRange` for highlight:** `setTimeRange('upcoming')` meant highlighted past events were immediately filtered out. Changed to `setTimeRange('all')` so the highlighted event is always visible regardless of time.
4. **`useFeedLogic.ts` — memory leak in recursive `scrollToHighlight`:** Only the first `setTimeout` was returned in the cleanup function; the recursive retry and the 5 s clear timer were never cancelled on unmount. Replaced with a `timers[]` array that `clearTimeout`s every timer in the cleanup.
5. **`FeedFilters.tsx` — `TimeRange` type missing `'all'`:** Added `'all'` to the union so the `setTimeRange('all')` call in `useFeedLogic` is type-safe.
6. **`FeedFilters.tsx` — filter/time buttons missing `type="button"` and `aria-pressed`:** Both the time-range toggle buttons and category chip buttons lacked `type="button"` (could submit a parent form) and `aria-pressed` (screen readers had no active-state indication). Added both to all buttons.
7. **`FeedSkeletons.tsx` — loading skeleton invisible to screen readers:** `FeedSkeletons` had no ARIA semantics. Wrapped in a `<div role="status" aria-busy="true" aria-label="Loading events">` to match the project pattern.
8. **`FeedSidebar.tsx` — dead `statsDialogOpen` and `announcementsDialogOpen` states:** Both state variables were declared and their dialogs rendered, but no UI element ever toggled them open. Removed both state variables and their Dialog JSX. Also added Space key support (`e.key === ' '`) to the categories card `onKeyDown`.
9. **`FeedClient.tsx` — hardcoded red color classes in delete modal:** `bg-red-100`, `text-red-500`, and `bg-red-500 hover:bg-red-600` violated the "no hardcoded hex/raw Tailwind colors" rule. Replaced with `bg-mq-error/10`, `ring-mq-error/20`, `text-mq-error`, `bg-mq-error hover:bg-mq-error/90`.
10. **`PublicEventCard.tsx` — non-MQ `categoryColors` and `bg-emerald-600` added-state:** All category color classes (`bg-blue-50`, `text-blue-700`, etc.) replaced with MQ tokens (`bg-mq-info/10 text-mq-info border-mq-info/20`, etc.). The "added to calendar" button state `bg-emerald-600 hover:bg-emerald-700` replaced with `bg-mq-success hover:bg-mq-success/90 border-mq-success`. Also simplified the redundant `categoryStyle.bg.replace(...)` no-op to `categoryStyle.bg`.
11. **`FeaturedEventsBanner.tsx` — non-MQ `categoryGradients`, missing nav/dot ARIA:** `from-blue-600 to-blue-800` etc. replaced with `from-mq-info to-mq-info/70` etc. Previous/next nav buttons missing `aria-label` and `aria-hidden` on their icons. Dot buttons missing `type="button"` and `aria-current`.
12. **`EventDetailModal.tsx` — non-MQ `categoryStyles` gradients and `bg-emerald-600` added-state:** `from-blue-500 to-blue-700` etc. replaced with `from-mq-info to-mq-info/70` etc. Added-state button `bg-emerald-600 hover:bg-emerald-600` replaced with `bg-mq-success hover:bg-mq-success/90 border-mq-success`.
13. **`AnnouncementsSection.tsx` — non-MQ `typeStyles` colors:** `bg-emerald-500`, `bg-blue-500`, `bg-amber-500`, `bg-purple-500` and their `text-` / `hover:border-` variants replaced with MQ tokens (`bg-mq-success`, `bg-mq-info`, `bg-mq-warning`, `bg-mq-purple`).
14. **`QuickStats.tsx` — non-MQ `CategoryBar` colors, non-MQ `StatCard` color, and hardcoded `'en-AU'` locale:** `bg-blue-500`, `bg-emerald-500`, `bg-purple-500`, `bg-amber-500` in `CategoryBar` replaced with `bg-mq-info`, `bg-mq-success`, `bg-mq-purple`, `bg-mq-warning`. `text-purple-500/bg-purple-500/10` in `StatCard` replaced with `text-mq-purple/bg-mq-purple/10`. `EventCard` hardcoded `'en-AU'` in both `toLocaleTimeString` and `toLocaleDateString`; replaced with a `localeMap` driven by `useTypedTranslation().language`. `EventCard` `categoryColors` also replaced with MQ tokens. Merged two `useTypedTranslation()` calls into one.
15. **`PublicFeedFilters.tsx` — wrong Input import path:** `@/components/ui/input` (base shadcn) replaced with `@/components/ui/mq/input` (MQ-themed wrapper) for visual consistency.

### Leo: Map Page Bug Hunt & Production Hardening — 2026-04-06

**Scope:** Bug fixes, performance, accessibility, type safety, and i18n compliance across 5 map files

1. **`MapClient.tsx` — URL truncation always appended `...`:** `copyShareableURL` used `url.toString().substring(0, 50)}...` unconditionally, appending `...` even for short URLs. Fixed by only adding the ellipsis when `urlStr.length > 50`.
2. **`MapClient.tsx` — redundant `document.title` effect:** A `useEffect` set `document.title` at runtime, which is redundant with (and can flicker against) the `metadata` export in `app/map/page.tsx` that Next.js App Router already injects as a `<title>` tag. Removed the effect.
3. **`MapClient.tsx` — `selectedBuildingName` semantic mismatch:** `RouteAnnouncer` received `selectedBuilding?.id` (e.g. "C5C") as the building name for screen reader announcements (e.g. "Navigating to C5C"). Fixed by passing `selectedBuilding?.name` (the human-readable English name).
4. **`MapClient.tsx` — duplicate comment:** `{/* Combined Map Wrapper */}` appeared twice on consecutive lines (646–647). Removed the duplicate.
5. **`MapClient.tsx` — non-memoized CampusMapHUD callbacks:** Three inline arrow functions were passed as props to `CampusMapHUD` — `onStartNavigation`, `onStopNavigation`, and `onClearExternalPlace` — recreated on every render, forcing unnecessary child re-renders. Extracted and memoized all three with `useCallback`.
6. **`MapPageSkeleton.tsx` — inaccessible loading skeleton:** The outer `<div>` had no ARIA semantics, making the page-level Suspense fallback invisible to screen readers. Added `role="status"`, `aria-label={t('loadingMap')}`, and `aria-busy="true"`.
7. **`position-editor/page.tsx` — non-MQ semantic Tailwind classes:** `PositionEditorLoading` used `bg-gray-100 dark:bg-gray-900` (background), `text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400` (text), and `border-red-600` (spinner). Replaced with `bg-mq-background`, `text-mq-content-secondary`, and `border-mq-primary`.
8. **`CampusMapHUD.tsx` — hardcoded hex colours:** The Google Maps-mode selected building highlight used `bg-[#d2e3fc] dark:bg-[#1a3a5c]`. Replaced with `bg-mq-primary/15 dark:bg-mq-primary/10` to use the MQ primary token.
9. **`CampusMapHUD.tsx` — category capitalized in JSX instead of i18n:** The selected building card displayed the category using `charAt(0).toUpperCase() + slice(1)` (raw JavaScript string manipulation, bypassing i18n). Fixed by importing `BUILDING_CATEGORY_LABELS` from `@/features/map/lib/buildings` and using `t(BUILDING_CATEGORY_LABELS[selectedBuilding.category])`, consistent with how `CampusMap.tsx` already renders the same data. Also merged the two separate `@/features/map/lib/buildings` import lines into one.
10. **`CampusMap.tsx` — hardcoded `#4285F4` hex in SVG fill:** The "locate me" button SVG used `fill="#4285F4"` (Google blue) to indicate GPS found. Replaced with `fill="var(--mq-primary)"` to respect the MQ brand token system.

**Files Changed:**

- `features/map/components/MapClient.tsx`
- `features/map/components/MapPageSkeleton.tsx`
- `features/map/components/CampusMapHUD.tsx`
- `features/map/components/CampusMap.tsx`
- `app/map/position-editor/page.tsx`

**Verification:**

- TypeScript: `npm run typecheck` — clean (no map-source errors) ✅
- Lint: `npm run lint` — clean ✅
- Tests: 874/878 passed ✅ (4 pre-existing signup failures, unrelated)

### Leo: Calendar Page Bug Hunt & Production Hardening — 2026-04-06

**Scope:** Bug fixes, performance, accessibility, and type safety across 6 calendar files

1. **`CalendarClient.tsx` — view buttons broke URL sync:** Three desktop view-toggle buttons called `setView(...)` directly, bypassing `handleViewChange`. This meant switching views didn't update the URL, breaking deep-links, back/forward navigation, and share-by-URL. Fixed by destructuring `handleViewChange` from `useCalendarView()` and wiring it to all three buttons. Also added `aria-pressed` to each button for screen-reader active-state indication.
2. **`CalendarClient.tsx` — `isToday` variable shadowing:** Inside the mobile day-row `map`, a local `const isToday` shadowed the outer `isToday` from `useCalendarView`. Renamed the inner variable to `isDayToday` to eliminate the ambiguity and prevent latent bugs.
3. **`CalendarClient.tsx` — timezone bug in todo form:** `new Date(editTodoDueDate)` creates a UTC midnight Date object. When combined with `setHours` (which applies local time), the resulting `dueDate` is wrong in any timezone west of UTC. Fixed by using `dayjs(editTodoDueDate).hour(...).minute(...).toDate()` which stays in local time throughout.
4. **`CalendarClient.tsx` — non-memoized handler functions:** 9 local handlers (`handleDeleteAssignment`, `confirmDeleteAssignment`, `handleDeleteExam`, `confirmDeleteExam`, `confirmDeleteDeadline`, `handleDeleteEvent`, `confirmDeleteEvent`, `handleDeleteTodo`, `confirmDeleteUnit`, `handleUnitDetailOpenChange`, `getUnitsForDay`, `getItemsForDay`) were re-created on every render, giving child components fresh prop references every render. Wrapped all in `useCallback` with correct dependencies.
5. **`CalendarClient.tsx` — mobile day buttons inaccessible:** Day buttons in the mobile date selector showed only a letter + number with no accessible name. Added `aria-label` with full weekday name and day number (plus "(today)" suffix) and `aria-hidden` on the decorative spans. Also destructured `formatWeekdayLong` from `useCalendarGetters` for this.
6. **`useCalendarHighlights.ts` — event highlight re-fires on store refresh:** The event-highlight effect lacked a `processedRef` guard that unit/deadline/todo highlights all have. On any Zustand store update that re-ran the effect, the detail dialog re-opened. Added `processedEventHighlightRef` and the standard reset guard to match the other highlight patterns.
7. **`useCalendarView.ts` — dead condition `hours >= 24`:** `dayjs().hour()` returns 0–23, making the `|| hours >= 24` branch unreachable. Removed it and added an explanatory comment.
8. **`useCalendarData.ts` — duplicate imports:** `createBrowserClient` and `isSupabaseConfigured` were imported from `@/lib/supabase/client` on two separate lines. Merged into one.
9. **`useCalendarDialogs.ts` — hardcoded `'#10b981'` hex colour:** The default todo colour violated AGENT.md's "no hardcoded hex values" rule. Replaced with `DEFAULT_TODO_COLOR = UNIT_COLORS[3].value` (sourced from `@/lib/config`).
10. **`page.tsx` — inaccessible loading skeleton + redundant ARIA role:** `CalendarSkeleton` had no `role="status"`, `aria-busy`, or `aria-label`. Added all three. Also removed `role="main"` from the `<main>` element — `<main>` already carries the landmark implicitly.

**Files Changed:**

- `app/calendar/page.tsx`
- `app/calendar/CalendarClient.tsx`
- `features/calendar/hooks/useCalendarView.ts`
- `features/calendar/hooks/useCalendarHighlights.ts`
- `features/calendar/hooks/useCalendarData.ts`

### Leo: Home Page Bug Hunt & Production Hardening — 2026-04-06

**Scope:** Bug fixes, performance, accessibility, and type safety across 7 home-page files

1. **`HomeClient.tsx` — duplicate landmark labels:** Two `<section>` elements shared an identical `aria-label={t('dashboardOverview')}`, creating duplicate region landmarks for screen readers. Fixed by removing the `aria-label` from the events/todos grid section (unnamed sections don't become landmarks — correct for a sub-grid).
2. **`HomeClient.tsx` — unsafe navigation in error state:** `window.location.href = '/'` bypassed the Next.js router, causing a full-page reload instead of client-side navigation. Replaced with `router.push('/')`.
3. **`HomeClient.tsx` — portal target comment:** Documented WHY the `typeof document` guard is safe for portals (React's hydration algorithm does not compare portal content at the component mount point).
4. **`AuthRedirectHandler.tsx` — supabase client recreated on every render:** `createBrowserClient()` was called in the component body. Moved to `useMemo([], ...)` so the client is created once per mount. Also imported `Session` type and replaced `session: unknown` with `session: Session | null` in the `onAuthStateChange` callback for proper type safety.
5. **`useHomeData.ts` — unnecessary store subscriptions:** `_isLoadingUnits` and `_isLoadingDeadlines` were subscribed from their Zustand stores but never read. Each subscription causes a re-render on every loading-state change. Removed both unused subscriptions.
6. **`useHomeUser.ts` — displayName recomputed every render:** The name-derivation logic was an IIFE, recomputing on every render regardless of whether `user` or `currentProfile` changed. Wrapped in `useMemo([user, currentProfile])`. Also added `useMemo` to the React import.
7. **`WeekHeatStrip.tsx` — full `motion` bypassed `LazyMotion`:** Importing `motion` from `framer-motion` forces the full animation bundle even when `<LazyMotion features={domAnimation}>` is active in the parent. Replaced with `m` (the lightweight variant designed for use with `LazyMotion`).
8. **`loading.tsx` — inaccessible loading skeleton:** The skeleton container had no ARIA semantics — screen readers had no way to identify it as a loading state. Added `role="status"`, `aria-label="Loading dashboard"`, and `aria-busy="true"`.
9. **`WelcomeHeader.tsx` — dead fallback branch:** `messageKey ? t(messageKey) : t('dayAtGlance')` — `messageKey` is always truthy (always a string from the `generalKeys` array), so the `t('dayAtGlance')` fallback was unreachable dead code. Simplified to `t(messageKey as 'welcomeMsg1')`.

**Files Changed:**

- `app/home/HomeClient.tsx`
- `app/home/loading.tsx`
- `app/AuthRedirectHandler.tsx`
- `features/home/hooks/useHomeData.ts`
- `features/home/hooks/useHomeUser.ts`
- `features/home/components/WeekHeatStrip.tsx`
- `features/home/components/WelcomeHeader.tsx`

### Leo: Fix Select Dropdowns Not Opening Inside Dialogs — 2026-04-05

**Scope:** UI bug fix — Radix Select z-index + Dialog interaction guard

1. **Root cause 1 — z-index clash:** `SelectContent` was styled with `z-50` while Dialog overlay/content uses `z-[70]`. The Select portal rendered behind the dialog, making dropdowns invisible and unclickable in all dialogs (UnitForm day picker, ReminderModal timing picker, etc.).
2. **Root cause 2 — blanket `preventDefault`:** `ReminderModal` called `e.preventDefault()` unconditionally in `onPointerDownOutside` and `onInteractOutside`, blocking Radix Select portal interactions even if z-index were fixed.
3. **Fix 1:** Bumped `z-50` → `z-[80]` in `SelectContent` so the dropdown portal always renders above the dialog layer.
4. **Fix 2:** Narrowed the `preventDefault` guard to skip events whose target is within a `[data-radix-popper-content-wrapper]` element, preserving "click outside to dismiss" protection while allowing Select portals to function.

**Files Changed:**

- `components/ui/select.tsx`
- `components/ui/ReminderModal.tsx`

**Verification:**

- TypeScript: `npm run typecheck` — clean ✅
- Lint: `npm run lint` — clean ✅
- Tests: 876/878 passed ✅ (2 pre-existing signup failures unrelated to this change)

### Leo: Internationalization Update — 2026-04-06

**Scope:** i18n Expansion (34 Locales)

**Summary:** Added missing `heroSection`, `opensInNewTab`, and `loadingEvents` keys to all 34 translation files in `locales/`. Used localized translations for major languages (Arabic, German, Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, Chinese, Japanese, etc.) and English fallbacks for others. `heroSection` is used for ARIA labels on hero sections; `opensInNewTab` provides an accessible suffix for links; `loadingEvents` is used for screen reader status updates during feed loading.

**Files Changed:** `locales/*/translations.json` (34 files).

**Verification:** Ran `npm run check:i18n` — all 35 locales validated successfully ✅.

**Follow-ups:** None.
